//    `name` is not.)
//  - The function borrows `vc` transiently.
//  - The returned pointer is borrowed from `vc` and is valid until
//    `vc` is destroyed.
//
// ERRORS:
// - Returns NULL if `name` is not present in `vc` and cannot be
//   added because `vc` is full.
// - Prints a message to stderr and exits with code 1 if we need
//   to allocate a copy of `name` and allocation fails.
